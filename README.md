## Overview

Train a segmentation model with a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. The system estimate uncertainty and generates pseudolabels for confident predictions.

Key steps:
- Base supervised training on a small labeled set
- Class-wise calibration of uncertainty thresholds
- Pseudolabel generation for the unlabeled set
- Iterative retraining with new pseudolabels

## Dataset Structure

The expected dataset layout is as follows. 

```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ masks/
â”œâ”€â”€ val/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ masks/
â””â”€â”€ unlabeled/
    â””â”€â”€ images/
```
A few annotated samples are provided to understand annotation format.


## Configuration file

Training is controlled by a YAML file (example: ./configs/custom.yaml)
Classes should be defined in the YAML file.
